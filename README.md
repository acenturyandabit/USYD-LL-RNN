Can you teach a computer to love?

Ahh, the wonders of ~~modern technology~~ python. You can spin up a neural network that generates random sentences based on a body of text in like, 5 lines of code.

Thanks to ~~science~~ javascript, you can create a bot to scroll down USYD Love Letters Revived and capture some 4,260 lines of relationship angst, in another 5 lines of code.

And then you get some... interesting... results. Like these gems:
